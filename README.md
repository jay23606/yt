# yt

MP3 downloader that can also burn audio CD

Pretty simple just update input.txt with album you'd like to burn 

Or you can have the software look it up on wikipedia by entering this at the command line: 

yt "album name" "artist name"

Make sure to put cdbxpcmd.exe under C:\burn

The artist name should be simplified as much as possible because it looks for the name in the video title or description and only downloads the song if it appears there
